> CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build,
> test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation
> process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files,
> and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler
> environment of your choice. The suite of CMake tools were created by Kitware
> in response to the need for a powerful, cross-platform build environment for
> open-source projects such as ITK and VTK.
