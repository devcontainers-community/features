> The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
> toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with
> traditional virtual machines. The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it is
> the full name of the project.

&mdash; [The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure]

> Clang is an "LLVM native" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver
> amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to
> provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static
> Analyzer and clang-tidy are tools that automatically find bugs in your code,
> and are great examples of the sort of tools that can be built using the Clang
> frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code.

&mdash; [The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure]

> The Clang project provides a language front-end and tooling infrastructure for
> languages in the C language family (C, C++, Objective C/C++, OpenCL, CUDA, and
> RenderScript) for the LLVM project. Both a GCC-compatible compiler driver
> (clang) and an MSVC-compatible compiler driver (clang-cl.exe) are provided.

This feature installs the LLVM suite of tools. This includes Clang! We are using
the official `llvm.sh` installer script from [LLVM Debian/Ubuntu packages].
