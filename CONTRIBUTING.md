## FAQ

### What qualifies as a feature?

Features are generally medium-to-large blocks of software that are tooling for a
particular ecosystem. Things like programming languages ([Deno], [C++],
[Haskell], [Julia]) with their popular associated tooling ([pnpm], [Poetry],
[CMake], [Gradle]), and popular standalone tools ([MySQL], [Emscripten], [act],
[Terraform]) are good examples of things that are features. Things that aren't
features are things like package manager items ([TypeScript], [TensorFlow],
[Prettier]).

A good rule of thumb üëç is that if it's **installed in a folder** or via a
**lang-chain dependency manager** (i.e. able to be installed per-project), it's
probably **not a feature**. If it's **global**, it might be **worth a feature**.
